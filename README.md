# Seventh Project - News App, Stage 2

PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
 
1. Settings Activity allows users to see the value of all the preferences right below the preference name, and when the value is changed, the summary updates immediate.

2. App contains a main screen which displays multiple news stories.

3. The title of the article and the name of the section that it belongs to are required field.
   If available, author name and date published should be included. Please note not all responses will contain these pieces of data, but      it is required to include them if they are present.
   Images are not required.
   
4. Settings Activity is accessed from the Main Activity via a Navigation Drawer or from the toolbar menu. 
   In accordance with Material Design Guidelines, it should be reached via the "Settings" label. Do not use synonyms such as "Options" or    "Preferences."
   
5. The code runs without errors.

6. App queries the content.guardianapis.com API to fetch news stories related to the topic chosen by the user, using either the ‘test’ api    key or the student’s key. The query is narrowed down by the preferences selected by the user in the Settings. 
   
7. Networking operations are done using a Loader rather than an AsyncTask.

8. The intent of this project is to give you practice writing raw Java code using the necessary classes provided by the Android framework;    therefore, the use of external libraries for the core functionality will not be permitted to complete this project.
